# Lazy Cat Search Engine

## Description

This is the Module 2 final exam for the [Adalab](https://adalab.es/) Front End Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid, Spain. This module is all about Javascript so that's where the bulk of the project is.

The assignment is to create a TV series search engine using the [TVmaze open API](http://www.tvmaze.com/api). Minimum requirements include:

- A text input box and submit button
- Contact server and display results (a name and photo for each series, providing a placeholder photo if a series doesn't have its own)
- Allow for a favorites list that can be created by clicking on each series we want to add to the list
- Favoriting a series changes the background color of series in search results
- Favorited series must be displayed in a favorites list section
- Save favorites list in local storage

As extras, we are given some suggestions:

- The option to delete series from the favorites list (must update local storage too)
- A delete all favorites button
- The ability to delete a favorite by clicking on the series in the search results (resetting the background color)
- Favorited series show up already marked in search results (background color changes are applied each time new search results are shown)
- Polish up the overall design
- Anything else we can think of

To help keep my code (and thoughts, plans...) organized, I created a flowchart:

I am very happy with how the project turned out, but I'm still very much learning so please let me know how I can improve. Thanks!
